title: After Spring Break
---

<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
The first week back from spring break has been pretty hectic. They say the weeks before summer go by a lot faster after spring break. I have no doubt that is due to the rush of final projects, presentations, and reports that gets introduced and assigned during this period of time. 

For SWE, we weren't introduce to final project. Well, kind of. We were given a large project that was divided to smaller parts. My team and I finsished the first part of it this past week. The first iteration proved to be more of a challenge than any of us had inticipated. The team all worked really hard on it, but we weren't able to finish it before the deadline. 

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
Even with it broken down to smaller parts, I underestimated the scale of the project. I am certain the rest of my team feels the same way. As a team, we decided that we would rather turn our assignment in late than turn in an incomplete project. We learned our lesson this time around and will definitely not underestimate our next assignment.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
This upcoming week I will be getting a head start on the second iteration of IDB with my team. We definitely don't want a repeat of what happened this past week.
