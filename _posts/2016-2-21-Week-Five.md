<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
[Wes](http://wesdraper.github.io) and I concluded Netflix this past week. We weren't able to get our root mean square error below 0.95 but we learned a lot during this project. I am pretty comfortable dealing with pickle files now.

In class we talked more about iterators and generators. [Downing](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/) also touched on how they are implemented differently from Python 2.7 to 3. I've always assumed language developers would move heaven and earth to keep the implementations of the language as similar as possible from one version to the next, so that the new version doesn't break any legacy programs written in the older versions. That issue didn't seem to bother the Python developers that much. I guess the trade-off was probably worth it to them.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
I had several interviews with a couple of different companies this past week. It was definitely a challenge juggling classwork, studying for interviews, along with having the actual interviews themselves. It is certainly keeping me on my toes. Hopefully I hear good news soon. Y'all wish me luck. I have a feeling I might need it. 

The busy schedule had me falling slightly behind on my readings. I need to find some time to catch up and start studying for the exam.


<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
Next week, I will be focusing my efforts on the upcoming exam. It is the first exam for this class, so I have no idea what to expect. Starting early will hopefully give me enought time to go over everything covered in class, as well give me an opportunity to go to office hours with any questions or confusions I might have.


<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
[Carnegie Mellon has a youtube channel on software engineering.](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSEICMU) They cover various subjects on software engineering as well as occasionally hosting guest speakers that talk about projects that they are working on, or the state of the industry. It is a very informative channel and I hope those of you reading get a chance to check it out.
