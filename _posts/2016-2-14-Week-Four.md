title: Netlix and Chill
---

<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
Week four has been pretty chill. My partner, [Wes Draper](http://wesdraper.github.io) and I started on the Netflix algorithm project. We have made a lot of progress this week. Getting the program to correctly build has been relatively painless for Netflix in comparison to the Collatz project. I attribute this to experience. We have grown wise in the past two weeks, and gained something that remarkably resembles knowledge and intuition. Jokes aside, had we been given the Netflix project before Collatz, there is no way things would be going as smoothly as it has been. It is nice to feel that you are actually make progress as you learn and apply your skills, however small the increments, so a big shoutout to our professor, [Glenn Downing](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/). 

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
Learning how to use Python pickle files proved to be more of a challenge then I had initially inticipated. I think I was just psyching myself out, making everything out to be a lot more complicated than it actually is. Pickle files turn out to be really simple and intuitive, though my partner and I learned the hard way that having half a dozen pickle files open is a great way to make a ton of mistakes and create even more bugs if you are not careful. Oh well, what can you do right? You live and learn.


<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
Netflix is due Thursday so I will definitely be focusing my attention on that. We have most of it done. Our root mean square error is below 1 right now, but we are shooting for the 5 extra points by going for a sub 0.95. If us two geniuses somehow manage to get our RMSE below 0.85, don't worry, we'll let Netflix know. 


<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
I learned a lot about [pair programming](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/pairing.html) working with Wes this week. For those of you skeptics out there, I encourage you to give it a try. I have found that I am a lot more focused, productive, and effective while working in tandem with a partner. Having someone hold me accountable and coding out loud really makes a difference on the quality of code you can produce.
