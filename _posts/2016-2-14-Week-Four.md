title: Netlix and Chill
---

<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
Week four has been pretty chill. My partner, [Wes Draper](http://wesdraper.github.io) and I started on the Netflix algorithm project. We have made a lot of progress this week. Getting the program to correctly build has been relatively painless for Netflix in comparison to the Collatz project. I attribute this to experience. We have grown wise in the past two weeks, and gained something that remarkably resembles knowlegde and intuition. Jokes aside, had we been given the Netflix project before Collatz, there is no way things would be going as smoothly as it has been. It is nice to feel that you are actually make progress as you learn and apply your skills, however small the increments, so a big shoutout to our professor, [Glenn Downing](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/). 

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
Learning how to use Python pickle files proved to be more of a challenge then I had initially inticipated. I think I was just psyching myself out, making everything out to be a lot more complicated than it actually is. Pickle files turn out to be really simple and intuitive, though my partner and I learned the hard way that having half a dozen pickle files open is a great way to make a ton of mistakes and create even more bugs if you are not careful. Oh well, what can you do right? You live and learn.


<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
I plan to get a head start on the next project. I want to at least get a basic grasp on the scope of the assignment. It feels like I have finally start to hit a rhythm with everything I am doing and I am not planning to miss a beat. 


<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
There is a game called Stockfighter that many of you reading may be interested in. It is a free capture the flag programming challenge game that lets you participate and manipulate in a virtual trading market. Hone your skills while playing a game, what could be better? It has more to do with software security than actual development, but security is definitely something that you should keep in mind while developing software, so it is totally related. Anyways, for those of you who want to try it out, here's a link: [stockfighter.com](https://www.stockfighter.io/).
