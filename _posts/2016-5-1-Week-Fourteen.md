<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
The presentation for my team's IDB project was this past week. Along with the presentation for my data management class, it has been a rather hectic week of crunch time and last minute edittings. The presentations went well. We ran into some trouble with our search implementation when our browser decided to cache an empty page and just kept returning it anytime we did a search. It was a small hiccup in an overall pretty good presentation.

Explaining six weeks of work in a short fifteen minute presentation was a new experience for me. The team split the presentation into smaller parts for each member of the team to explain. I each had a few minutes of speaking time, but the short minutes didn't feel nearly long enough to fully convey our weeks of work. I know it is better this way, since spending more time praddling on about the technical aspects of the project that everyone in the room already know about anyways is in no way a good use of time. I guess it truly was just a bitter sweet experience finishing this project.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
I've always had a fear of public speaking that's held me back from speaking to larger groups of people. I've been working hard at correcting this odd anxiety though, and I feel that it has paid off, as evident from the two presentations I've had to give this past week. They weren't anything spectacular, but definitely a big step forward from the awkward silences and empbarrasing mumblings I've passed off as speeches in the past.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
I will be studying for the array of finals I have coming up these next two weeks.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
After talking about the different iterations of the IDB project I have been working on these past few weeks, I haven't had the pleasure of introducing my amazing teammates that's worked so hard alongside me through these trials and tribulations. Whether you are a hiring manager considering new candidates for a job opening or a student looking for a partner, these great guys of team BASKS come with glowing recommendations: [Bryan Quimio](https://github.com/brianquimio), [Adam Alloy](https://github.com/adamalloy), [Stephen Perl](https://github.com/shperl), and [Keith Gibson](https://github.com/kdgbsn). My advice for you is to get to know these guys.
