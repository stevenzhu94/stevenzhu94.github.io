<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
The last iteration of the three part project, IDB, is at hand. I've been working on trying to complete this behemoth of an assignment with my team. The past week, we have been really focused on trying to make sure the whole team, both front-end and back-end members, understood how the application works as a whole. I've been mostly focused on back-end development for the past two iterations of the project so it's been really helpful getting to know more about the front-end workings.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
There were a few residual bugs left from the last iteration of our project, so before the team could move on, we had to patch all the bugs and made sure everything was working smoothly before we moved on. It took a large chunk of our time to smooth everything over so it slowed our schedule a little bit, but our team leader this time is very good about keeping up with the schedule and reworking our workload as situations change.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
I will be focusing all my efforts on finishing the last iteration of IDB, and working with the team to make sure our presentation for this project reflect the amount of work and sweat we've all put into it.
