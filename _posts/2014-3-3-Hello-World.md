<h2>Getting Started</h2>
The first week has been a blur. It has been an anxious mix of trying to settle into a routine, along with the fear that I might have to restructure my entire semester before that could happen. It took me nearly all of the first week to finally get off of the waitlist and into Software Engineering. The waitlist that I have been on since before the end of the last semester. The waitlist that had initially placed me as number 88 of 88 extra people trying to get into this class. The waitlist that had me at number 30 at the beginning of the semester. The waitlist that had somehow miraculously added me to CS373 right before the waitlists closed for good until the next round of registrations. Waiting to get added to this class had me spending almost the entirety of my first week coming up with contingencies in case I didn't get added to the class. Restructuring my schedule over and over again trying to piece the next year of my life together. Of course, even though being added to the class roster has been a blessing, being add to the class late also meant that I had missed most of the introductions for this class and even a little bit of the first lessons. Having a late start being in my way canâ€™t stop me though. Next week, next week I will get into my routine and start anew. I will get a start on the Collatz project and hopefully have a clearer idea of what the semester ahead will bring.
<h3>Tip of the week</h3>
Stick with it. At times you will feel like you are at a complete loss, whether in regards to programming or just life in general. If this past week has taught me anything, it is that perseverance pays off. Do not stop until you get the results that you want.
