title: A Rough Time
---

<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
As the title suggests, this past week has been pretty rough. My team members and I really struggled with IDB2. Because of various bugs, we had a lot of difficulty deploying our database. Due to the nature of Docker and Carina, the application containment and container management software we have been utilizing for our project, it has been pretty difficult to debug our application. 

From what I have been gathering, Docker is quickly becoming the industry standard for application development, so I am really grateful to be able to get some hands on experience with it. The learning curve is pretty steep, but that just makes it even more imperative to learn it now, rather than scrambling to make sense of it while working in the industry.

We didn't get to implement every feature that we wanted to include into the app, but my team and I were able to finish IDB2 on time. It was a really close call, but the whole class received a 24 hour extension on the deadline for this assignment. Apparently multiple groups were having trouble deploying their website, much were.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
Due to everyone's unfamiliarity with Docker, there were times when we would sit there at a loss of what to do. It was very difficult debug our application at times, but that's just the nature of the beast. As we become more familiar with Docker, these instances would likely occur less and less.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
After the late submission with IDB1 and the close call with IDB2, I will definitely be working on the third iteration with more focus this week.
