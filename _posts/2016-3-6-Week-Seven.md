<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
We took the midterm for SWE this past Thursday. I won't lie, it was pretty challenging. The questions were fair, but a couple really caught me off guard. As usual, time was the limiting factor. I need to get better at thinking on my feet.


<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
It's the middle of the semester so nearly all of my classes are going full blast with projects, exams, homeworks, and quizzes. It is a lot of work and a lot of stress. Trying to find some personal time is near impossible, so I guess I feel a little burned out. Any extra time I get is a near impossible choice between some much needed rest or some much needed studying. I need to get better at time management.

There is definitely a sense of directionlessness when there seems to be endless an amount of work to do. However, having no work to do feels almost as uncomfortable. I guess, as with everything in life, moderation is key.


<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
Spring break is coming up; so are many exams. I will be using all my effort to finish strong before the upcoming break. That means a lot of reading, studying, and finishing any lagging projects. I will be using the break as a chance to apply for some more internships. Needless to say, I don't plan on making any crazy spring break memories this year.


<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
You can never study enough for an exam, especially if the exam is for a programming class. I cannot speak from experience, but I would be highly surprised if I don't come across some variation of the questions I have had in exams, when I start working in the industry.
