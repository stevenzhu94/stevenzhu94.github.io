<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
We took the midterm for SWE this past Thursday. I won't lie, it was pretty challenging. The questions were fair, but a couple really caught me off guard. As usual, time was the limiting factor. I need to get better at thinking on my feet.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>


<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
Spring break is coming up; so are many exams. I will be using all my effort to finish strong before the upcoming break. That means a lot of reading, studying, and finishing any lagging projects. I will be using the break as a chance to apply for some more internships. Needless to say, I don't plan on making any crazy spring break stories.
