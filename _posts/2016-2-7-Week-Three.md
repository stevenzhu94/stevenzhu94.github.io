title: Getting Things Rolling

<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
This past week had me preoccupied with finishing the collatz project. There was a few hiccups along the way: Travis failing all of a sudden, badly written tests, wrongly implemented caches; there was no shortage of objectives to meet and things to fix. It has also been quite the learning experience getting used to the ins and outs of GitHub. During the week, it was easy to feel overwhelmed at times juggling responsibilities for software engineering with responsibilities for my other classes along with other duties I had otherwise committed myself to. Looking back however, things are almost never as hecktic as they appear in the heat of the moment. Nevertheless, it has still been a rather busy week overall. 

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
With the career fair this past Tuesday and the project being due Thursday, I had fallen quite badly behind on my readings and reviewing of materials for this class. Still, I had done better on the quizzes this past week than I had originally anticipated. I could still do better though, so I definitely plan to. With the first project over with, there should be less things in my way now as long as I stay on top of all of my responsibilities.


<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
I plan to get a head start on the next project. I want to at least get a basic grasp on the scope of the assignment. It feels like I have finally start to hit a rhythm with everything I am doing and I am not planning to miss a beat. 


<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
There is a game called Stockfighter that many of you reading may be interested in. It is a free capture the flag programming challenge game that lets you participate and manipulate in a virtual trading market. Hone your skills while playing a game, what could be better? It has more to do with software security than actual development, but security is definitely something that you should keep in mind while developing software, so it is totally related. Anyways, for those of you who want to try it out, here's a link: [stockfigher.com](https://www.stockfighter.io/).
