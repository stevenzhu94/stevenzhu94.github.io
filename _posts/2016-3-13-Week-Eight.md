title: Week Before Spring Break
---

<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
I had multiple exams for my other classes this past week, but for SWE it was a relatively tame week. The new project, IDB1, has been assigned so I spent the week looking for a group to join. Downing talked us through some of the different parts of the assignment and what was expected from us on this project. It seems like he is kicking it up a gear as this project is pretty large in comparison to the two past assignments.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
Spring break is figuratively right around the corner, so I find it kind of hard to concentrate. No surprise there. Hopefully, I'll get all the rest I need in the first few days and be ready to get a head start on this project.

I found my team for this next project, and it seems like everyone is eager to get a head start on this assignment. Everyone on the team is really enthusiastic and very competen; I can't wait to find out how well we all work together.


<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
It's spring break so I will probably be doing a whole lot of nothing, and a tiny bit of something that is actually productive. Hopefully I'll do just enough where I won't look back and regret not making better use of my time. With all of these distractions around, I honestly can't make any promises. 


<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
Sometimes it's worth it to take a break and treat yourself to some quality rest and relaxation. The worst thing you can do is to burn yourself out, so be mindful of not pushing yourself too hard. It's spring break! Just be ready to come back with some steam, and tackle whatever is in your way.
