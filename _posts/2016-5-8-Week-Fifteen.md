<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
This past week was the last week of classes, and this will likely be my last post. I can't believe it's already another semester. I spent this past week mostly doing different things to finish up work for all of my classes. For SWE, I spent the week mostly studying up and then taking the final for the class.

As expected, the final was difficult. The format was really similar to the first exam so I felt better prepared for this one since I didn't know what it was going to be like going into the first test. The exam hasn't been graded yet, but I do feel pretty good about my performance on it. However, I am still pretty anxious to find out what I made, since it does account for a large portion of my final grade for the class.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
There wasn't much in my way this past week, except I can't get over how it has been another semester already. Day by day it feels like nothing changes, but looking back, I'm always surprised by how much I learn over the course of one semester.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
Next week is the beginning of finals week. I will be mostly studying and then taking finals for my classes. I have three finals coming up. It sounds pretty bad, but as long as I stay diligent about my studies, I feel confident I'll do well. Anyways, wish me luck.
