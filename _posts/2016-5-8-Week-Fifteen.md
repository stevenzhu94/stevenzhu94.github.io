<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
This past week was the last week of classes, and this will likely be my last post. I can't believe it's already another semester. I spent this past week mostly doing different things to finish up work for all of my classes. For SWE, I spent the week mostly studying up and then taking the final for the class.

As expected, the final was difficult. The format was really similar to the first exam so I felt better prepared for this one since I didn't know what it was going to be like going into the first test. The exam hasn't been graded yet, but I do feel pretty good about my performance on it. However, I am still pretty anxious to find out what I made, since it does account for a large portion of my final grade for the class.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
There wasn't much in my way this past week, except I can't get over how it has been another semester already. Day by day it feels like nothing changes, but looking back, I'm always surprised by how much I learn over the course of the semester.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
Next week is the beginning of finals week. I will be mostly studying and then taking finals for my classes. I have three finals coming up. It sounds pretty bad, but as long as I'm diligent about my studies, I feel confident I'll do well. Anyways, wish me luck.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
My last tip for you all is to enjoy the summer. I know most of us who study computer science have a tendency to waste away hours in front of a laptop screen, and not know where the flies. Don't spend all summer staring at a screen, even if you have a job that requires you to, or a personal project you really want to work on that you've been putting off until break. Go outside, spend time with friends, you'll thank yourself on the last day of summer. Then you can thank me too. I wish you all the best of luck with all your future endeavors. Peace!
