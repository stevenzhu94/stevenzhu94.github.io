<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
I spent this week finishing up the last iteration of IDB with my team. Everyone worked really hard, so we are all extremely proud of our final product. However, I would be remiss not to mention that the final version of our app does not truly reflect all the hours of loving labor we put into it. 

I would say that only about 30% of our work actually bore fruit. The rest 70% accounted for many hours, even days, of trial and error, frustration, and fruitless endeavors. Ironically, I believe that that 70% of the work we put into this assignment is where we learned the most. That 70% is what I will be taking away from these three iterations of IDB. Go figure.

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
There are always stubborn bugs to fix, this time was no exception. The team did a fantastic job in communicating problems within the code, and figuring out how to solve them. We were mostly successful. The problems we were unsuccessful in solving was definitely not due to a lack of trying. If you had to guess, guess what percentage of our efforts went into trying to solve these issues.

<h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
We are presenting our final product this coming week in class, so wish us luck.

<h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
Failure is learning. It always has been and always will be part of the learning process. Never underestimate how educational failures can be. We try so often to evade failure, we neglect to see the benefits that failure can bring. Don't try to evade it; embrace it, and then learn from it.
