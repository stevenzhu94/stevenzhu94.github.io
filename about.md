My name is Steven Zhu. I am a computer science student at The University of Texas at Austin. I have taken, am currently taking, and will be taking many computer science courses. This blog is about my experience in one of these courses; namely CS373, better known as Software Engineering.

### More Information

I am from a peaceful small town right on the cusp of the Texas/Louisiana border called Carthage. It is a small town with nice neighborhoods and even nicer people, so it might come as a surprise when I say I was eager to leave it. Maybe it's because Carthage is such a quiet place, or maybe because going from one city limit sign to another at the other end of town only takes a five minute drive, but growing up in that small corner of the Earth gave me an incredible wanderlust. I hope my work will take me around the world one day.
